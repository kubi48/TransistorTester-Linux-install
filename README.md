# TransistorTester-Linux-install
Scripts to install transistor tester sources and documentation 

You find here installation scripts to install
the TransistorTester archivs to your Linux System.

The script is currently tested with a Linux Mint 20.1 system,
but should work with Debian or Ubuntu based distrubutions. 
You can try the scripts also with Fedora and RedHat based
distribution and also for the Arch based distributions.

A Makefile can help you to call the the scripts.

You should clone this archiv to your computer with the following command:

git clone https://github.com/kubi48/TransistorTester-Linux-install

If git is missing at your system, you should install the git package
of your distribution with your package managerr. 
For example: sudo apt-get install git 

A 'make help' in the TransistorTester-Linux-install directory 
(usually ~git/TransistorTester-Linux-install) will show you the next steps.
